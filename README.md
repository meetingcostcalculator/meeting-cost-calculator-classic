**Update:** This repository has been replaced by [meeting-cost-calculator-hugo-ca](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-hugo-ca), an updated version of the Meeting Cost Calculator based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). This version has been archived.

======

Ever wondered how much your team meetings cost? The Meeting Cost Calculator lets you calculate an estimated cost for meetings, using the standard pay rates used by a variety of public sector organizations.

- Data for the core public service is adapted from the TBS Rates of Pay website, and data for the Canadian Armed Forces is adapted from the DND Pay Rates website.
- Meeting costs are determined by converting annual salaries into hourly rates, then multiplying these against the elapsed time. Salary classifications with a range of levels are simplified to minimum, maximum, and median rates, which can be selected under the gear options menu.
